# Student Attendance Tracker

Using Self Attendance Tracker, students can track their class attendance on their own. They can:
1. See the classes they have to attend today
2. List of course for which attendance is being tracked and see presents, absents and cancelled classes per course
3. Create schedule for the week so that these schedule classes are repeated weekly
4. Create extra classes that are additional to the weekly schedule classes
5. See marked attendance record for a specific course
